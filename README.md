# Highino

**Highino** (pronounced *rhino*) is an alternative library for programming with Arduino boards. It aims to provide a higher level and easier interface, while being faster and smaller (in final compiled code size) than the equivalent Arduino code. It uses modern C++ features and a nice API.

## What does work

Currently very few is working. The only board tested is the Arduino Mega 2560, with the following features:

- Digital Input/Output
- Analog Input/Output
- Serial console (cout-like interface)
- Delay timers
- SPI interface

## What does not work

Everything else. Yes, that's a lot.
